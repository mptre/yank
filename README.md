Yank terminal output to clipboard.

Description
-----------

Read input from `stdin` and display a selection interface that allows a field to
be selected and copied to the clipboard. Fields are either recognized by a
regular expression using the `-g` option or by splitting the input on a
delimiter sequence using the `-d` option.

Using the arrow keys will move the selected field. The interface supports
several Emacs and Vi like key bindings, consult the man page for further
reference. Pressing the return key will invoke the yank command and write the
selected field to its `stdin`. The yank command defaults to [xsel] but could be
anything that accepts input on `stdin`. When invoking yank everything supplied
after the `--` option will be used as the yank command, see examples below. The
default yank command can also be defined at compile time, see compilation below.

Motivation
----------

Others including myself consider it a cache miss when resort to using the mouse.
Copying output from the terminal is still one of the few cases where I still use
the mouse. Several terminal multiplexers solves this issue, however I don't want
to be required to use a multiplexer but instead use a terminal agnostic
solution.

Examples
--------

  - Yank a environment variable key or value:

    ```
    env | yank -d =
    ```

  - Yank a field from a CSV file:

    ```
    yank -d \", <file.csv
    ```

  - Yank a whole line using the `-l` option:

    ```
    make 2>&1 | yank -l
    ```

  - If `stdout` is not a terminal the selected field will be written to `stdout`
    and exit without invoking the yank command. Kill the selected PID:

    ```
    ps ux | yank -g [0-9]+ | xargs kill
    ```

  - Yank the selected field to the clipboard as opposed of the default primary
    clipboard:

    ```
    yank -- xsel -b
    ```

Compilation
-----------

Run the following command:

  ```
  make
  ```

The default yank command can be defined using the `YANKCMD` variable. Example:
OS X users would use `pbcopy` as the default yank command:

  ```
  make YANKCMD=pbcopy
  ```

Alternatively put the `YANKCMD` variable declaration in your local `config.mk`
file.

Installation
------------

### Debian

On testing and unstable:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install yank
  ```

The binary is installed at `/usr/bin/yank-cli` due to a naming conflict.

Maintainer: SÃ©bastien Delafond <sdelafond () gmail ! com>

### OS X

  ```
  brew install yank
  ```

Maintainer: Carl Dong <dongcarl () fastmail ! fm>

### From source

The install directory defaults to `/usr/local`:

  ```
  make install
  ```

Change the install directory using the `PREFIX` variable:

  ```
  make PREFIX=DIR install
  ```
